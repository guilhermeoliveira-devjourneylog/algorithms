## Scenario

The assignment tasks you with implementing one or more algorithms to solve the 2SAT problem across six different instances. 
Each instance is provided in a file format where the number of variables and clauses are specified on the first line, followed by clauses represented by 
two literals per line, with the "-" sign indicating logical "not". The goal is to determine the satisfiability of each instance and 
represent the result as a 6-bit string, where each bit corresponds to an instance (1 for satisfiable, 0 for unsatisfiable).

The task offers flexibility in choosing the algorithm, suggesting options like computing strongly connected components in a suitable graph, 
using Papadimitriou's randomized local search algorithm with potential modifications for efficiency, or employing backtracking as 
described in the Dasgupta-Papadimitriou-Vazirani book.
