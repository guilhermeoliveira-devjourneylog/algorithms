## Scenario

The problem involves solving a knapsack instance described in a file format that includes the knapsack size, number of items, values, and weights for each item. 
The challenge lies in handling a significantly large instance that renders a straightforward iterative approach impractical due to time and space constraints. 
The suggested solution involves employing a recursive approach, solving subproblems as needed while caching results to prevent redundant computations. 
Additionally, choosing appropriate data structures for storing and retrieving subproblem solutions is essential for efficient implementation.
