## Scenario

The content describes a knapsack problem instance, detailing the format of the input file and the information it contains. 
Each line represents an item with its associated value and weight. 
The task is to implement the knapsack algorithm to find the optimal solution given the knapsack size and the items available. 
All numbers are assumed to be positive integers, and both item weights and knapsack capacity are expected to be integers. 
The challenge ends by prompting the reader to provide the value of the optimal solution based on the given input.
