## Scenario

The task involves implementing a clustering algorithm to compute the maximum spacing 

k-clustering. The input file contains a description of a distance function or a complete graph with edge costs. 
Each line in the file represents an edge between two nodes with the corresponding cost. 
The goal is to find the maximum spacing of a 4-clustering.

Other question running a clustering algorithm on a significantly larger graph where distances are implicitly defined rather than explicitly provided. 
The format of the input file includes the number of nodes and the number of bits for each node's label, followed by the bits associated with each node. 
The distance between two nodes is measured using the Hamming distance, representing the number of differing bits between their labels. The objective is to determine the largest value of 
k such that a k-clustering with a spacing of at least 3 exists. This entails finding the minimum number of clusters required to ensure that no pair of nodes with all but 2 bits in common are separated into different clusters. Due to the immense size of the graph, traditional methods such as explicitly listing edges or sorting them by cost are impractical, necessitating alternative strategies to identify the smallest distances efficiently.
