## Scenario

The assignment requires the implementation of algorithms for the all-pairs shortest-path problem on three given graphs. 
Each graph is described by a data file specifying its vertices, edges, and their lengths, some of which may be negative. 
The task is to identify if any of the graphs contain negative cycles. For graphs without negative cycles, the goal is to compute all-pairs shortest paths and determine the smallest one among them. If all three graphs have negative-cost cycles, "NULL" is to be entered. If only one graph has no negative-cost cycles, the length of its shortest shortest path is to be entered. 
If multiple graphs have no negative-cost cycles, the smallest length among their shortest shortest paths should be entered. 
The implementation can utilize any suitable algorithm, and optionally, different algorithms can be compared for performance.
