## Scenario

The assignment tasks with implementing algorithms for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), specifically suggesting the use of dynamic programming. 
A data file is provided, describing a TSP instance. The file includes the number of cities and the coordinates of each city in the plane. 
The distance between two cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula. 
The asked to compute the minimum cost of a traveling salesman tour for this instance, rounding down to the nearest integer.
