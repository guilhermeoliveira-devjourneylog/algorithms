## Scenario

The task is to implement and execute the randomized contraction algorithm for the min-cut problem on the 
given graph to compute the min cut. Figure out how to perform edge contractions efficiently. 
Additionally, it's crucial to run the algorithm multiple times with different random seeds and remember the smallest cut found.

The file contains the adjacency list representation of a simple undirected graph. 
It has 200 vertices labeled from 1 to 200. Each row, except the first column, lists the vertices adjacent to the vertex 
labeled in the first column. For instance, the 6th row looks like: "6 155 56 52 120 ...", indicating that vertex 
6 shares edges with vertices 155, 56, 52, 120, and so on.
