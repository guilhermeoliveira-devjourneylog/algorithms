## Scenario

This programming problem involves implementing a dynamic programming algorithm to compute the maximum-weight independent set of a path graph. 
The input file contains the weights of vertices in the graph, listed in the order of their appearance in the path. The task is to determine, 
using the dynamic programming algorithm and reconstruction procedure, which vertices out of a specific set belong to the maximum-weight independent set. 
The set comprises vertices numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 17, 117, 517, and 997. The solution requires entering an 8-bit string where each bit represents whether 
the corresponding vertex is in the maximum-weight independent set or not.
